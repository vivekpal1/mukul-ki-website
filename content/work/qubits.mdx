## Qubit

A qubit (or quantum bit) is the quantum mechanical analogue of a classical bit. In classical computing the information is encoded in bits, where each bit can have the value zero or one. In quantum computing the information is encoded in qubits. A qubit is a two-level quantum system where the two basis qubit states are usually written as \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle∣0⟩ and \left\lvert 1 \right\rangle∣1⟩. A qubit can be in state \left\lvert 0 \right\rangle∣0⟩, \left\lvert 1 \right\rangle∣1⟩ or (unlike a classical bit) in a linear combination of both states. The name of this phenomenon is superposition.

## Qubit technologies

Several different physical implementations of qubits are possible. A number of examples are the polarizations of a photon, two of the (multiple) discrete energy levels of an ion, a superconducting Transmon qubit, the nuclear spin states of an atom or the spin states of an electron. Quantum Inspire is designed to control different qubit technologies. Its modular design allows it to re-use components that are technology independent while replacing components (software and hardware) that are technology dependent.
